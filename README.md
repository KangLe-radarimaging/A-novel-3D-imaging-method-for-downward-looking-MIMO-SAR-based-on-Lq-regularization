Downward-looking multiple-input-multiple-output synthetic aperture radar (MIMO-SAR) three-dimensional (3D) imaging has wide application prospects. But to realize high cross-track resolution imaging needs lots of antenna elements and long antenna array, which are limited by the hardware. In this paper, a novel imaging method for downward-looking MIMO-SAR based on L q regularization is proposed to solve this problem, which transforms the cross-track imaging process in to a L q regularization model by building and analyzing a structured over-complete dictionary based on the echo signal. With the proposed method, better resolution can be obtained and a smaller amount of antenna elements is required for imaging compared to the conventional method. The proposed method has been verified by simulations.
